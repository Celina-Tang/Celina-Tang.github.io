          <p>  Hi, I'm Celina, a software engineering student at University of Waterloo. </p>
			    <p> After discovering programming from robotics three years ago, I became extremely intrigued with the magic of programming and the possibilities that could be created with code. My curiousity and adventurous personality gave me the desire to exxplore various fields in software development, such as designing and creating websites, games, apps, and softwares that would contribute something to this world. </p>
			    <p> Outside of programming, I love playing games, ranging from the legendary single player RPG, <em>The Elders Scroll: Skyrim</em>, to the strategic card game that makes you lose friends, <em>Exploding Kittens</em>, to the thrilling casino favorite, <em>Poker</em>. Furthermore, I enjoy drawing and painting, because it allows me to release my creativity, just like creating useful technology with code. </p>

                <p> In the summer of 2015, I had a co-op opportunity as a software developer at Quanser Consultant Inc and created 3 demo projects for their new product, Qbot2. My projects centered on demonstrating the functionalities of Qbot 2 and possible experiments that could perform with its control system.</p>
                <p><em>"Leader and Follower":</em> Used dead reckoning with XY coordinates from encoders and gyro calculations to track and pursue the leader Qbot; their coordinate locations were updated through the network communication to increase the accuracy of the calculation </p>
                <p><em>Image Processing Program: </em>Performed a threshold on the RGB values acquired from Qbot2 to target and recognize specific object of certain shape and colour</p>
                <p><em>Lidar Infrared Area Mapping: </em>Analyzed depth data acquired from Lidar and created a mapping of the surrounding area; incorporated in path planning algorithm </p>

                <p> Team 4001 is a FIRST Robotics team from St. Robert CHS. I, as the team captain, was proud to lead a team of 85 members, dedicated many hours everyday after school to my work in robotics. Walking down the path of discovering my passion, I grew from an oblivious beginner in two years to an experienced programmer, leading the programming subteam. I realized that I had a strong interest in programming, which gave me the motivation to persist and excel in self-learning necessary technical skils. During the heat of competition, I presented our technical report on the robot to the judges, which earned my team the Industrial Design Award. This dedication of working diligently towards a dream eventually allow the team to win the Regional Champion at the Greater Toronto Central Regional Competition and play in World Championship quartfinals at St. Louis, USA.</p>
